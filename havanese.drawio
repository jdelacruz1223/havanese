The game is intended as accessible as possible, with low barrier of entry and little need for dependent resources, such that player engagement is as simple as opening, entering their name, and pressing play. For that intention, [Game Name] is to be 100% played on browser, using a service like itch.io for build hosting and public visibility, using a WebGL build of the game running Unity 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Game Name] places the player in a zombie apocalypse scenario, where they are equipped with firearms and a stock of three lives. The goal is to progress throughout the game&#39;s campaign, with various increases of difficulty in the form of unique challenges and dynamic difficulty system. The player dies once they take enough damage to their health and run out of lives, in which the game ends and must be started from the beginning once more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign is assembled in a level-by-level format, with each level featuring a unique challenge that would suggest the &#39;theme&#39; of the level that the player must overcome in order to progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each level of the campaign will be split up by individual encounters. An encounter consists of a set number of enemies relative to the number of players in the session. Once all players have cleared all their enemies for the encounter, the game progresses to the next encounter until the level sequence is complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players can join forces in a team of up to 3 players, where each player can be invited by either a room code or a shared link. The number of enemies in each encounter grows as there are more players in the session. When a player runs out of lives, they will remain &#39;incapacitated&#39; (unable to play), until the start of a new level, assuming the remaining player(s) make it to the end. While a number of players are incapacitated, the number of zombies will remain the same for the rest of the level. Once all players are incapacitated, the game ends.&lt;/p&gt;" style="text;html=1;whiteSpace=wrap;overflow=hidden;rounded=0;" vertex="1" parent="1">
